# Performance-optimized config: Use NeMo's original encoder for better performance
# This is a copy of nest_fast-conformer.yaml with encoder using NeMo's original implementation
# 
# Usage: Copy this file and modify the encoder target to use NeMo's original implementation
# 
# To switch back to NeMo's encoder, change:
#   encoder:
#     _target_: modules.conformer_encoder.ConformerEncoder
# to:
#   encoder:
#     _target_: nemo.collections.asr.modules.ConformerEncoder
#
# Note: This will use NeMo's optimized implementation which may have better performance
# but alignment has been verified with the local implementation.
